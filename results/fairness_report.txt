⚖️ FAIRNESS ANALYSIS REPORT
==================================================

📊 OVERALL MODEL PERFORMANCE:
Overall Accuracy: 0.831
Overall Precision: 0.789
Overall Recall: 0.938

👥 PERFORMANCE BY GENDER:
Male (0):
  Accuracy: 0.805
  Precision: 0.739
  Recall: 0.895
Female (1):
  Accuracy: 0.889

⚖️ FAIRNESS METRICS ASSESSMENT:
🔴 demographic_parity_difference: 0.272 - POOR
🔴 demographic_parity_ratio: 0.673 - POOR
🟠 equalized_odds_difference: 0.127 - CONCERNING
🔴 equalized_odds_ratio: 0.682 - POOR

📋 INTERPRETATION:
- Demographic Parity: Equal positive prediction rates across genders
- Equalized Odds: Equal true/false positive rates across genders
- Values closer to 0 indicate better fairness
- Ratios closer to 1 indicate better fairness

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:
⚠️ Fairness issues detected:
   - demographic_parity_difference: POOR
   - demographic_parity_ratio: POOR
   - equalized_odds_difference: CONCERNING
   - equalized_odds_ratio: POOR

🔧 Suggested Actions:
1. Consider fairness-aware training methods
2. Apply post-processing fairness techniques
3. Collect more balanced training data
4. Review feature engineering for bias
