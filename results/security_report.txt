💡 SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS:

🛡️ GENERAL SECURITY MEASURES:
1. Establish secure data collection pipelines
2. Implement data provenance tracking
3. Use statistical tests to detect label anomalies
4. Deploy multiple models for cross-validation
5. Regular model retraining with verified data
6. Implement model monitoring and drift detection

🔧 MITIGATION STRATEGIES:
1. Data Sanitization: Remove suspicious samples before training
2. Robust Training: Use techniques like RONI (Reject on Negative Impact)
3. Byzantine-Robust Algorithms: Use aggregation methods resilient to outliers
4. Certified Defense: Implement provably robust training methods
5. Federated Learning: Reduce single points of failure
