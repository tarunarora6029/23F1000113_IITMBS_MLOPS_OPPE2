Investigate root causes of distribution shifts\n2. Collect more recent training data\n3. Consider online learning or model adaptation\n4. Implement continuous drift monitoring\n5. Set up automated alerts for drift detection\n\n\ud83d\udcc1 Generated Files:\n- evidently_drift_dashboard.html (Interactive dashboard)\n- evidently_drift_profile.json (Detailed metrics)\n- drift_results.json (Summary results)\n- drift_report.txt (This report)"
