==================================================
Analysis Time: 2025-08-24 14:15:28.187300
Tool: Evidently AI

📊 OVERALL DRIFT SUMMARY:
Total Features Analyzed: 13
Features with Drift: 13
Drift Percentage: 100.0%
Dataset-level Drift: Yes

💥 POTENTIAL IMPACT:
🚨 CRITICAL: >50% of features show drift
   - Model performance may be significantly degraded
   - Immediate retraining recommended

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Investigate root causes of distribution shifts
2. Collect more recent training data
3. Consider online learning or model adaptation
4. Implement continuous drift monitoring
5. Set up automated alerts for drift detection
